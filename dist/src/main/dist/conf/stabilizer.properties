# Hazelcast Version Configuration
# =====================================================================
#
# The workers can be configured to use a specific version of Hazelcast; so you don't need to depend on the Hazelcast
# version provided by the stabilizer, but you can override it with a specific version.
#
# The Hazelcast version can be configured in different ways:
#   none                    : if you worker is going to get maven installed through worker dependencies, for
#                             for more information checkout out the --workerClassPath setting on the Controller.
#   outofthebox             : if you are fine with the default configured version.
#   maven=version           : if you want to use a specific version from the maven repository, e.g.
#                                   maven=3.2
#                                   maven=3.3-SNAPSHOT
#                             Local Hazelcast artifacts will be preferred, so you can checkout e.g. an experimental
#                             branch, build the artifacts locally. Then these artifacts will be picked up.
#   path=dir                : if you have a directory containing the artifacts you want to use.

# JDK Installation
# =====================================================================
#
# Warning:
#   Currently only 64 bit JVM's are going to be installed if you select something else then outofthebox.
#   So make sure that your OS is 64 bits! On option to select 32/64 bits will be added in the future.
#
# The following 4 flavors are available:
#   oracle
#   openjdk
#   ibm
#   outofthebox
# out of the box is the one provided by the image. So no software is installed by the Stabilizer.
#
JDK_FLAVOR=openjdk

#
# If a 64 bits JVM should be installed. Currently only true is allowed.
#
JDK_64_BITS=true

#
# The version of java to install.
#
# Oracle supports 6/7/8
# OpenJDK supports 6/7
# IBM supports 6/7/8 (8 is an early access version)
#
# Fine grained control on the version will be added in the future. Currently is is the most recent released version.

# =====================================================================
# Profiler configuration
# =====================================================================
#
# Warning: Yourkit only works on 32/64 bit linux distro's for the time being. No support for windows
# or mac.
#
# The worker can be configured with a profiler. The following options are
# available:
#   none
#   yourkit
# When Yourkit is enabled, a snapshot is created an put in the worker home directory. So when the artifacts
# are downloaded, the snapshots are included and can be loaded with your Yourkit GUI.
#
PROFILER=none

#
# The settings for Yourkit agent
#
# Make sure that the path matches the JVM 32/64 bits. In the future this will be automated.
#
# The libypagent.so files, which are included in Stabilizer, are for "YourKit Java Profiler 2013".
#
# For more information about the Yourkit setting, see:
