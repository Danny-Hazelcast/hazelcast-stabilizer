hazelcast-stabilizer
===========================

A tool for stress testing Hazelcast and Hazelcast based applications in clustered environments. This can be in a local
machine, but can also be in a cloud like EC2 or Google Compute Engine. The Stabilizer makes use of JClouds, so in theory
we can roll out in any cloud.
